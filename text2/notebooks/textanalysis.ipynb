      "## Similarity metrics\n",
      "\n",
      "An early exploratory level analysis that you might want to perform is *similarity*.  How similar are your documents to each other?  Once you are operating under the vector space model, you can compute different types of distances between word vectors; Euclidean, Hamming, Jaccard, cosine, and so forth.  \n",
      "\n",
      "It's currently quite popular to use cosine distances, so let's review what a cosine distance is and how to compute it.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Cosine distance\n",
      "\n",
      "Think back to your days in grade school geometry.  Cosine is a measure of an angle between two vectors.  If the vectors are heading towards points very distant from the other, the angle between the two vectors will be very large.  If they are heading towards a similar point in space, the angle will be very small.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since we have represented documents as word vectors, we can find the cosine distance between documents and treat the resulting angle as an estimate of similarity based on word occurrences and frequencies.  Similarity tends to be recalculated as `1 - distance` so a cosine score of 1.0 means exactly identical.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some excellent, more in-depth summaries of the math behind cosine distances as they relate to text in vector space:\n",

      "   \n",
      "We could go into more detail about how to compute cosine distance, but luckily scikits-learn has made this easy for us.  We can multiply the tfidf sparse matrix object by its transpose and get cosine distances."
