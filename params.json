{"name":"IRiSS 2013 Workshop: Shell, Text1, and Text2","tagline":"Materials for the Text units 1 and 2 for the IRiSS CSS workshop 2013","body":"### IRiSS CSS Workshop\r\n\r\nIn 2013 I taught a few parts of a [computational social science workshop](https://css-center.stanford.edu/workshops) at Stanford hosted by the Institute for Research in the Social Sciences.  All of the in-class demonstration code are now available for download.\r\n\r\nYou can either check out the content from shell with `git` installed or with the GitHub client.  If you've never used git or GitHub before, [here are some instructions](https://help.github.com/).\r\n\r\nYou can also download the .zip or .tar.gz.  You will need something that will let you open [IPython Notebooks](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).  That will allow you to work with the code directly. \r\n\r\nI tried to make the code easy enough for complete Python novices to get up and running.  Think of these lessons as a jumping-off point and a reference for future text analysis.\r\n\r\n## Shell\r\nComing soon!\r\n\r\n## Text 1 and 2\r\n\r\nText 1 was encoding, file formats, and regex.  Text 2 was text cleaning, TF-IDF, and simple classification.  If you don't want to download the data, you can check out the materials by following these links to the notebooks as static webpages:\r\n\r\n1. [Encoding](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/7576978)\r\n2.
