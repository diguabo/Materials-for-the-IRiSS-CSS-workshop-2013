A CSV file is distinct from a simple text file.  As a person working with a CSV file, there are actions you want to perform on the file that are afforded by the CSV structure.  For example, CSV files have *rows* and *columns*, unlike a simple text file, which is usually best thought of as a collection of strings, perhaps on new lines. \n",

I will always treasure this thoughtful and special gift.<p>_Girlfriends_ is a collection of stories that explore and celebrate female friendship through the eyes, ears, and hearts of everyday women.  Some of the women were friends for a lifetime, others for a short time. However, all understood and/or demonstrated the meaning of &quot;true friendship.&quot; For example, the stories included everything from the thankful musings of a once-ill woman about the extraordinaty kindness of her girlfriends to a giggly account of how two eerily-simiar best friends met as assigned roomates their first day of college. (The latter tale struck very close to home in a wonderfully spooky way.)<p>While many of the stories tugged at the heartstrings, I never felt manipulated by the authors. (Note: Part of the reason why I don't like the &quot;Chicken Soup for the Soul&quot; series is that I feel that the authors are just dying to make the reader clutch for the box of tissues.)  Rather, I appreciated the &quot;real&quot; tone of the stories, as they read like good conversation shared over a nice pot of Hazlenut coffee.<p>Some readers have commented on the book's simple language and lack of depth. I don't think the goal here was to explore the psychology of friendship, rather I think it was intended to be a simple and beautiful celebration meant to be enjoyed by &quot;Girlfriends&quot; everywhere.
